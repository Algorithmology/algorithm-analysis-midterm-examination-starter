# Introduction: Read This First! {{{

# Keep in mind these considerations as you implement the required functions:

# --> You must implement Python functions to complete each of these steps,
# bearing in mind that one defective function may break another function.

# --> Your source code must adhere to industry best practices in, for instance,
# source code formatting, variable naming, and documentation.

# --> You may refer to the checks that are specified in the exam/gatorgrade.yml file
# in this GitHub repository for the configuration and name of each tool used
# to analyze the code inside of this file.

# Instructions:
# Implement the following function that inputs the contents of a file
# so that it adheres to all aspects of the following specification.

# Function specification:
# The function find_minimum_value should:
# - Take a list of lists of integers, called matrix, as its parameter
# - Return an integer that represents the minimum value in the matrix

# TODO: If the function is called with an invalid input (e.g., an empty
# matrix), it should return None.

# TODO: This function may not not have all of the correct type annotations for
# certain variables. You must add all of any needed type annotations
# so that the function and any code that uses it passes the type checker.

# TODO: This function may not have a docstring and thus it may not adhere
# to industry best practices for Python source code. You may need to add a docstring
# so that this function is correctly documented by an algorithm engineer using it.
