## üßó Introduction

If you are a student completing this assessment as part of a class at Allegheny
College, you will need to complete the programming tasks according to the
instructions inside of the Python source code files in the `exam/questions/`
directory of this repository. If you have questions about this assessment,
please see the course instructor during the assessment time period. You must
read and ensure that you understand all of the instructions in this file before
starting the assessment.

## üòÅ TODO: Student Name

TODO: You must delete `Student Name` and add your name to the subsection header

## üöß Honor Code

**IMPORTANT**: All students in this course are obligated to adhere to the
Allegheny College Honor Code throughout the completion of this assessment. If
the instructor detects that a student has committed a likely violation of the
Allegheny College Honor Code, this will result in the filing of a report with
the Dean of Students Office and the furnishing of all details about the likely
violation. Please make sure that you review the [Allegheny College Honor
Code](https://sites.allegheny.edu/about/honor-code/) before you start to take
this assessment.

## üåü Re-type the sentence "I adhered to the Allegheny College Honor Code while completing this examination."

TODO: You must retype the sentence here in order to digitally sign your pledge.

**IMPORTANT:** If you do not type the required sentence then the course
instructor will not know that you adhered to the Allegheny College Honor Code
while completing the assessment.

TODO: Please list here the sources that you consulted while completing the examination!

## üåê Examination Overview

- **Examination Released**: At the start of your laboratory session
- **Examination Due**: At the end of your laboratory session

**Please note that your `git push` access to the GitHub repository containing
the assessment will be disabled after the assessment's due date.**

- The assessment is out of a total of 100 percent, with an automatically reported percentage.
- You must provide answers to all these questions by typing in the Python source code files.
- The final version of the Python source code file must be in your GitHub repository by the due date.
- You may run the automated assessment in your terminal window by using the `gatorgrade` command.
- Unless you already made special arrangements with the instructor, no late work will be accepted for this assessment.
- You may review details from running the automated assessment in GitHub by using the GitHub Actions tab.
- Your final score for this assessment is subject to revision following review by the course instructor.
- You may talk to the course instructor if you have questions about or you need troubleshooting help with this assessment.

## üìì Distribution Requirements

The Algorithm Analysis class enables a student to fulfill the requirements for
the QR and SP distribution requirements, as described below.

- **Quantitative Reasoning (QR)**: Quantitative Reasoning is the ability to
understand, investigate, communicate, and contextualize numerical, symbolic, and
graphical information towards the exploration of natural, physical, behavioral,
or social phenomena.

- **Learning Outcome**: Students who successfully complete this requirement will
demonstrate an understanding of how to interpret numeric data and/or their
graphical or symbolic representations.

- **Scientific Process and Knowledge (SP)**: Courses involving Scientific
Process and Knowledge aim to convey an understanding of what is known or can be
known about the natural world; apply scientific reasoning towards the analysis
and synthesis of scientific information; and create scientifically literate
citizens who can engage productively in problem solving.

- **Learning Outcome**: Students who successfully complete this requirement will
demonstrate an understanding of the nature, approaches, and domain of scientific
inquiry.

## üìô Learning Objectives

Allegheny College‚Äôs educational program is designed so that its graduates are able to:

- **AC-1**: Think critically and creatively.

- **AC-2**: Communicate clearly and persuasively as speakers and writers.

- **AC-3**: Invoke multiple ways of understanding to organize and evaluate
evidence, and to interpret and make sense of their experiences and the
experiences of others.

- **AC-4**: Apply their knowledge and learning to engage in informed debate,
and to analyze and solve problems.

Computer Science 202 at Allegheny College is a core course in the Computer
Science major. Graduates with the Computer Science major, who all take the
Computer Science 202 course, must demonstrate their attainment of these learning
objectives:

- **CS-1**: Demonstrate and be able to communicate the knowledge of data types,
algorithms, and mathematical principles behind discrete objects.

- **CS-2**: Use scientific and theoretical methods to design, implement,
evaluate, deploy, improve, maintain, and document software and hardware systems.

- **CS-3**: Apply and articulate key concepts from a specialization area where
the interconnection between software and hardware is important and evident.

- **CS-4**: Able to communicate technical details of the produced software and
hardware artifacts both in writing and orally.

All five of the Computer Science major's learning objectives support the **QR**
and **SP** distribution requirements and the College's learning objectives.

The specific learning objectives for Computer Science 202 are as follows:

- **CS-202-1**: Correctly implement both well-established and custom data
structures using a programming language so as to solve a problem with a computer
program.

  - Enables the attainment of **CS-1**.

- **CS-202-2**: Perform an asymptotic analysis of an algorithm to arrive at its
correct worst-case time complexity class.

  - Enables the attainment of **CS-2**.
  - Enables the attainment of **CS-4**.

- **CS-202-3**: Conduct experiments that measure the efficiency of different
combinations of programming languages, data structures, and algorithms.

  - Enables the attainment of **CS-3**.

- **CS-202-4**: Use both theoretical and experimental results to pick the data
structure(s) and algorithm(s) that balance the trade-offs associated with
correctly and efficiently solving a problem with a computer program.

  - Enables the attainment of **CS-2**.

- **CS-202-5**: Effectively apply algorithmic problem solving techniques like
searching, sorting, and memoization to correctly and efficiently solve a problem
through the use of a computer program.

  - Enables the attainment of **CS-1**.

The learning objectives for Computer Science 202 enable the attainment of the CS
program learning objectives that in turn support the attainment of the College's
learning objectives.

**Finally, to ensure that this examination is _a real doozy_, answer all of the
following questions correctly to receive a 1% increase to your final grade on
this executable examination.**

- **Question 1**: What is the name of the instructor for this course?
- **Question 2**: What is the name of the department that offers this course?
- **Question 3**: What is the name of the instructor's dog?
- **Question 4**: What is the name of the instructor's cat?
- **Question 5**: Which of these five questions were generated by GitHub Copilot?
